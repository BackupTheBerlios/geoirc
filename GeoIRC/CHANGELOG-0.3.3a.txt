Changelog for GeoIRC 0.3.3a
---------------------------

Fixed support for multiple NAMREPLY messages.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Added a safety so that failure to load settings trips a flag that prevents
settings from getting saved.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Fixed parsing bug which assumed JOIN messages always have a colon before the
channel name.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Added support for half-op mode.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Setting dialog is now non-modal, which means it will stay on the top but GeoIRC
is also usable as long as settings dialog is open.
netseeker 2003-09-26

Added boolean switch "/gui/info windows/show root node" for configurable
enabling/disabling wheter the root node "Connections" should be drawn or not.
Added graphical configuration of this switch to "Visual Settings" in settings gui.
netseeker 2003-09-27

Various IRC messages dealing with channel names (e.g. JOIN, PART, etc.) now
treat channel names case insensitively.  (There were problems with servers that,
for example, capitalized the first letter of channel names in these messages.)
Pistos 2003-09-30

Changed assumption that all IRC server hostnames fit the mask "irc.*".  Mask is
now "\S+\.\S+\.\S+".
Pistos 2003-09-30

User-to-user PRIVMSGs and NOTICEs now spawn new windows.
Pistos 2003-10-01

Added "/misc/global pre-filter" setting.
Pistos 2003-10-01

Fixed bug so that reconnection is actually made when a connection is broken.
Channels are also rejoined.
Pistos 2003-10-02

Alternate nicks are actually used now.
Pistos 2003-10-02

Reworked the processing pipeline so that scripts have access to message
qualities, and can handle IRC messages with GeoIRC does not yet handle.
Pistos 2003-10-03

Fixed bug where receiving a RPL_NAMREPLY which had a user that we already had
in our channel membership would cause a deadlock.
Pistos 2003-10-03

Added an option to settings gui for exporting backups of the current settings
netseeker 2003-10-06

Added an option to settings gui for restoring settings backups
netseeker 2003-10-06
