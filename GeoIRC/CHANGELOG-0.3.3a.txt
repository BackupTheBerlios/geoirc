Changelog for GeoIRC 0.3.3a
---------------------------

Fixed support for multiple NAMREPLY messages.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Added a safety so that failure to load settings trips a flag that prevents
settings from getting saved.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Fixed parsing bug which assumed JOIN messages always have a colon before the
channel name.

Setting dialog is now non-modal, which means it will stay on the top but GeoIRC
is also usable as long as settings dialog is open.
