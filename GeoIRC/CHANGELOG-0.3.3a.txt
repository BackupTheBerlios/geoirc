---------------------------

Fixed support for multiple NAMREPLY messages.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Added a safety so that failure to load settings trips a flag that prevents
settings from getting saved.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Fixed parsing bug which assumed JOIN messages always have a colon before the
channel name.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Added support for half-op mode.
Pistos 2003-09-26

Setting dialog is now non-modal, which means it will stay on the top but GeoIRC
is also usable as long as settings dialog is open.
netseeker 2003-09-26

Added boolean switch "/gui/info windows/show root node" for configurable
enabling/disabling wheter the root node "Connections" should be drawn or not.
Added graphical configuration of this switch to "Visual Settings" in settings gui.

Various IRC messages dealing with channel names (e.g. JOIN, PART, etc.) now
treat channel names case insensitively.  (There were problems with servers that,
for example, capitalized the first letter of channel names in these messages.)
