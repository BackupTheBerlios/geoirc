Added nick-change reaction code, such that the user's own nick changes are
reflected in the internal variables only when the server actually allows the
nick change.  Other users' nick changes are also now printed.  Nicks are now on
a per-server basis.

Whoops, forgot to put the Ident server in an infinite loop to continually
serve Ident requests.

Reworked the input field focus issue... still not a satisfactory solution, but
better.  At least it lets you select text in the windows again.
