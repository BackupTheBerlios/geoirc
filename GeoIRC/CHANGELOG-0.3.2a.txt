order by channel mode and last activity descending) and reworked the existing
alphabetic sort ordering to return better results
netseeker 2003-09-24

ESCAPE does now close the settings dialog
netseeker 2003-09-24

Fixed problem where new server windows now have the filter
"irc.server.org and %raw and not %printed" instead of just "irc.server.org".
Pistos 2003-09-24

Delayed processing of server connection acknowledgement and channel restoration
until reception of the welcome message (IRC message 001).  Without this change,
channel join messages would be sent too early, and the server would ignore them.
Pistos 2003-09-24

Ping messages are now parsed for possible arguments, and the PONG response is sent
with the same argument.  Instead of printing to %debug, the pong message is 
printed with the qualities "%pong and <servername>".
Pistos 2003-09-24

Fixed bug where sending raw when there is no active server causes a
NullPointerException.
Pistos 2003-09-24

Added "quit" command.
Pistos 2003-09-24

Added "closewindow", "maximizewindow", "minimizewindow", "restorewindow",
"sizewindow" and "positionwindow" commands.
