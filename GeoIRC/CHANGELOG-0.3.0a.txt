Changelog for GeoIRC 0.3.0a
---------------------------

Began adding Python (Jython) scripting interface.
Pistos 2003-08-08

Changed the way processes of the exec command work such that their stdout and
stderr are sent to the DisplayManager with "process=<pid>" qualities, and text
typed when "process=<pid>" windows are in focus are sent to the process' stdin.
Pistos 2003-08-09 and 2003-08-10

Added execwithwindow command, so that exec will not create a new window for
the process output.
Pistos 2003-08-11

Reworked/fixed the input history.
Pistos 2003-08-12

Added the topic command.  Added RPL_NOTOPIC.  Added TOPIC message.

Fixed parenthesis parsing error in the boolean expression evaluator.
Pistos 2003-08-13

Automatic closure of channel windows under optimal conditions when parting
channels.
Pistos 2003-08-13

If a raw message is parsed and some interpretation is printed in at least one
other window, then a %printed quality is added to the raw print.
Pistos 2003-08-14

Added parsing for most channel mode messages.
Pistos 2003-08-15

xchat).  Can be set to 0 to disable.
Pistos 2003-08-20

Added a "connections/x/channels/x/autojoin" setting to allow enabling/disabling
of automatic channel joining at startup
netseeker 2003-08-21

Added settings gui "geoirc.conf.*", also added a "Settings->Options" menu entry
netseeker 2003-08-23

Modified scripting so that Python objects that register themselves with
geoirc.registerRawListener() have the ability to return a Python object with
"text" and "qualities" attributes, to alter the raw message that the
ServerReader handles.
Pistos 2003-08-29

Added a hidequalities command.
Pistos 2003-08-29

Fixed variable capturing so that parentheses are honoured, instead of capturing
the full regexp match.
Pistos 2003-08-29

Added a "/misc/word memory" settings subtree.  Tab-completion now works on words
in the conversation.
Pistos 2003-08-29

Fixed bug where the server itself (i.e. not a user with a nick) issues a MODE
message.
Pistos 2003-09-01

Fixed multiple info-panes bug.
Pistos 2003-09-05
