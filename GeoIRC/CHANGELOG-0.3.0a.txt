Changed the way processes of the exec command work such that their stdout and
stderr are sent to the DisplayManager with "process=<pid>" qualities, and text
typed when "process=<pid>" windows are in focus are sent to the process' stdin.

Added execwithwindow command, so that exec will not create a new window for
the process output.
